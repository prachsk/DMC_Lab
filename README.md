# The analysis of scRNA-seq and Patch-seq data to reveal the diversity of hypothalamic neurons classes

## Description:
Neurons in the lateral hypothalamus control several basic functions and behaviors that involve the evaluation of positive and negative signals in the environment. Hypothalamus contains a large number of different neuron types, which can be mapped using their molecular profile. The project will focus on analyzing available data sets from single-cell and single-nucleus RNA sequencing experiments to generate a comprehensive classification of neuron types in the lateral hypothalamus. These results will be combined with data from Patch-seq experiments of hypothalamic neurons that have projections to habenula, aiming to compare the correspondence between neuron type classification using electrophysiology versus gene expression. This classification will be the basis for mapping the different cell types in space in the adult mouse brain using in situ hybridization to detect spatial expression of putative cell type markers. Since the data used for this project are the unpublished data already generated by the lab and the published data from the Gene Expression Omnibus database, the main task for this project would be data integration and data analysis.
